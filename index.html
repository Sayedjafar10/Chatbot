          Java is a modern text-based programming language. According to an
          article from Northeastern University, Java is the 3rd most popular
          programming language today. Java has been around since 1995 and is
          most famously used in Android apps, the Minecraft desktop version, and
          behind-the-scenes code in websites and databases. Java is also the
          language of choice for AP Computer Science, a high school programming
          class that is considered equivalent to a first-semester college
          programming class. Java is well-liked because Java code can run on
          many types of devices, and it has a strong community of developers.
